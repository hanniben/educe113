        <h2 class="display-4">Prompt 6: Senses and Surroundings</h2>

        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p class="lead">Observe what attracts people's attention around the world.</p>

        <div class="img-header">
            <img src="images/p6-back.png"><img src="images/examples/ex_P6.png">
        </div>
        
        <h3>Start Here:</h3>
        <p>Go outside or sit by a window. What is the first thing you see, smell, or hear? What grabs your attention?</p>
        
        <h3>The Task:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you live in an urban, suburban, or rural area, find a similar area in another country.</li>
            <li>Research one or two possible sights, sounds, or scents that can be found in this other area.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consider:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How do these items relate to what is found where you live?</li>
            <li>How might their way of life reflect their senses and surroundings?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>I live in an urban area, and there are a few high rise apartment buildings being built in my neighborhood. I often hear construction noise, and the buildings themselves tower over their surroundings.
            <br>I decided to explore Kathmandu, Nepal, which is a similarly sized urban area. The Dharahara Tower was the tallest building in the city. It has been built and rebuilt a few times, starting in 1824. Multiple earthquakes have destroyed the structure, most recently in 2015. After the 2015 quake, the tower was rebuilt with earthquake resistant materials and inaugurated in 2021.
