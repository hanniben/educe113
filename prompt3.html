        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>How would you describe yourself? How do people around the world describe themselves?</p>
        
        <h3>Start Here:</h3>
        <p>List 3 parts of your identity.</p>
        
        <h3>The Task:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Observe the order that you chose for each part.</li>
            <li>Choose another culture, and learn what is important to their identities.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>Me: Companion, daughter, white
            <br>Māori: whakapapa (genealogy), religion, culture
            <br>The Māori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. The Māori identity is formed around whakapapa, which means genealogy. The whakapapa is what connects them to their land.
