        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>I’m often directly referred to by a nickname, “Ash”. Other times I am indirectly referred to by “daughter”, “granddaughter”, “miss”, and “ma’am”.
            <br>In Ghanaian, or Akan, culture, there is a naming system where people are given “day names.” That means that your first name would represent the day of the week that you were born on.
            <br><a href="http://www.afropedea.org/akan-names">Learn more about the system here.</a>
            <br>Since I was born on a Thursday, my first name would be “Yaa.”
            <br>There are also names used to indicate your birth-order. Since I am the first-born, that would be “Píèsíe.”
            <br>Other names that could be used to refer to someone like me are:
            <ul><li>Ɔbaa - woman</li>
            <li>Nana - grandchild</li>
            <li>Ɔbabaa - daughter</li></ul>
