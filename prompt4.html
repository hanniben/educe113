        <h3>Start Here:</h3>
        <p>Any names and nicknames that are used to refer to you (directly or indirectly).</p>
        
        <h3>The Task:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Think of how others refer to you.</li>
            <li>Find how people are referred to in another culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consider:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How might these names change between different relationships?</li>
            <li>What could be considered disrespectful?</li>
            <li>Do you use any similar terms in your relationships?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>I’m often directly referred to by a nickname, “Ash”. Other times I am indirectly referred to by “daughter”, “granddaughter”, “miss”, and “ma’am”.
            <br>In Ghanaian, or Akan, culture, there is a naming system where people are given “day names.” That means that your first name would represent the day of the week that you were born on.
            <br><a href="http://www.afropedea.org/akan-names">Learn more about the system here.</a>
            <br>Since I was born on a Thursday, my first name would be “Yaa.”
            <br>There are also names used to indicate your birth-order. Since I am the first-born, that would be “Píèsíe.”
            <br>Other names that could be used to refer to someone like me are:
            <ul><li>Ɔbaa - woman</li>
            <li>Nana - grandchild</li>
            <li>Ɔbabaa - daughter</li></ul>
