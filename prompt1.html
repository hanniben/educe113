        </h2>

        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective:</strong> Observe any differences in the translation and meaning of a word that is relevant to you.</p>

        <h3>Start Here:</h3>
        <p>A word that is relevant to you.</p>
        
        <h3>The Task:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a language that uses different characters from yours.</li>
            <li>Find a translation dictionary with definitions for that language.</li>
            <li>Look for a translation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consider:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there multiple translations?</li>
            <li>If there is no translation, is that because the word has no significance in the language?</li>
            <li>How are the characters drawn?</li>
            <li>How is the word pronounced?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>In Cantonese, 小朋友 - siu2 pang4 jau5 - directly translates to “small friends” and is used by adults to refer to children.
            <br>There are other translations as well. Some are more formal, some are specifically for parents or relatives. 小朋友 specifically is an informal or casual term that can be used by adults that are related or not. I honestly think the term “small friends” is a very cute way to refer to children.
            <br>“Siu2 pang4 jau5” is the jyutping, or romanization, of the characters. The numbers refer to the tone that is placed on the syllable. In this example, we would pronounce “siu” with a high rising tone, “pang” with a falling tone, and “jau” with a mid rising tone.
            <br>Chinese characters are written within a single square space, and the strokes are made in a specific order.
