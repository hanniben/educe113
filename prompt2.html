        <p>La Merc√® is an annual celebration held at the end of September in Barcelona, Spain. It celebrates the Virgin of Grace. Barcelona suffered from a swarm of locusts in the 1600s. They asked the Virgin of Grace to help eradicate the insects, which eventually did leave and celebrations began. Festivities include street parades, paper mache puppets, music, dance, and art.
